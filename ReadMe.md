## Illigal(toxic) Text Classification

### 1. Concept
Recently, as the number of online communities and SNS users increases exponentially, communication between people is expanding. However, some users use it correctly, but others have malicious intentions.  
In particular, there are users who post posts for the purpose of slandering others, illegal Toto, illegal promotions, and illegal drug sales posts. It can create discomfort for ordinary users who encounter these posts, and furthermore, there are more opportunities for ordinary people to access these illegal things.  
Therefore, in order to prevent such social problems, it is necessary to filter posts on online communities and SNS. 
Until now, posts are filtered by filtering users' reports and specific words, but this method is not only very inefficient, but also increases manpower consumption.  
Therefore, the method of automatically filtering these problems using artificial intelligence language models is effective, and manpower consumption is significantly reduced.
